# Handoff — Omega Thrust

## Scope

Overall: recompile Omega Boost (USA, SCUS-94449) with psxrecomp nightly
`8077e71`, playable through the whole game, then compare against the Beetle
oracle. Phases: 0 inputs, 1 scaffold, 2 generate + build + smoke, 3 discovery
cycles through the whole game, 4 Beetle comparison. Phase 5, at the user's
request, is modding: unlocks, branching, new levels, and later perhaps a fan
sequel or remake that borrows Colony Wars' free-roaming structure.

Current iteration, Phase 5 change 2 (the "unlock all zones and boost levels"
mod the user chose), round 1. Invariant: the game-owned package
`omega.cheat.unlock-all` (format 7, target SCUS-94449; feature `unlock-all`,
"Unlock All Zones and Boost Levels", group Cheats, off by default) selects the
trusted plugin `omega.unlock-all` (`src/mods/omega_unlock_all.c`, linked
through `EXTRAS_SOURCES`). While the feature is on, at every emulated VBlank
once the game has started, the plugin sets the zone flags A[0..18] and the
boost-level flags B[0..13] to 1, writing only bytes that differ and counting
each write. With the feature on, ZONE PLAY shows every zone and level OPENED
and DEMONSTRATION every entry SELECT OK, and a save made then holds the flags
with a correct checksum; loading that save with the feature off opens the same
on psx-runtime in all three boot modes and on psx-beetle in both of its modes.
With the feature off the plugin writes nothing, the game's own save is
unchanged, and all 22 committed routes pass in all three modes. The plugin
audit passes with the game's catalog and fails without it. `AGENTS.md`
documents the catalog, the plugin, the audit and how to run with a feature on
without touching `build-dev/mods/state.toml`; the doc records step 1 as done
and takes change 1's four round-2 doc suggestions; this file records change
1's round-2 PASS and commit `390a09b`, takes that round's handoff suggestion
and condenses change 1. Baseline: `390a09b`. Out of scope: runner, driver,
route and test changes; a committed feature-on route; other mods; framework,
submodule and `generated/` changes; play sessions (the launcher's Mods page);
CI, packaging.

## Phase 0 observations (`.cache/evidence/phase0/`)

- Nightly tarball `psxrecomp-src-nightly-20261007-8077e71098.tar.gz`: sha256
  `1b6dc4845ae7…` matches the release `SHA256SUMS` (itself sha256 `cf42077e15bd…`).
  Its `NIGHTLY_COMMIT` is `8077e71098ce0347d7d41d267630bc856816cf77`.
- `Omega Boost.chd` (sha256 `0fe927f9ee45…`): `chdman verify` passes (raw and overall SHA1).
- Extracted bin: 582616272 bytes, CRC32 `2f89bc87`, MD5 `f1f9af8786f8…`, SHA-1
  `772c58d8af1b…`, equal to Redump disc 1505 (USA, SCUS-94449, one track).
  chdman wrote the standard single-track `MODE2/2352` cue. Redump's cue file was
  not downloaded (its endpoint returned HTML). `disc-extract-verify.txt` has a
  blank `extract_exit=` because chdman's exit status was not captured; the
  digests above prove the extraction.
- SCPH-1001 dump on the share: sha256 `71af94d1e47a…`, CRC32 `37157331`, equal to
  the framework's SCPH1001 v2.2 profile. Not copied into the repository.
- Host: GCC 16.2.1, clang 23.1.1, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja 1.13.2, Python 3.14.7,
  SDL3 3.4.18, git 2.56.0, chdman 0.289, Linux 7.2.9 x86_64, 16 threads.

## Phase 1 (commit `6ad5c9e`)

Scaffold from the tarball's `setup_project.sh` (commit blocked), submodules
re-pinned to psxrecomp `8077e71` and recomp-ui `864f778`. Probe: SCUS-94449,
volume ID `OMEGABOOST`, boot EXE `SCUS_944.49` (sha256 `d9477ba8e9ad…`), entry
`0x80090334`, load `0x80010000`, text size `0x110800`, 697 seeds (the entry PC
plus 696 JAL targets). The full Phase 1 record (scaffold flags, checks, review
rounds) is in `git show 6ad5c9e:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Deliberate deviations from the raw scaffold output

- `framework_pins.txt` regenerated after re-pinning.
- `game_options.toml` tracked; the script leaves it untracked, but CMake stages
  it next to the executable and the packager reads it.
- `disc_probe.json` untracked and ignored: it records the absolute local
  `cue_path`, and only local scaffold tools read it. Its volume ID and boot EXE
  sha256 are recorded in `AGENTS.md` instead.
- `game.toml` `window_title` "Omega Thrust Recompiled" changed to "Omega Thrust".
  The runtime prefers `game.toml` over the compiled `WINDOW_TITLE`
  (`psxrecomp/runtime/src/main.cpp:14509`, `:14601`).
- Original-game wording (user decision): `.recomp.json` has `"game": "Omega
  Boost"` and `"project": "Omega Thrust"`; the README summary and the packager's
  `--disc-hint` say Omega Boost.
- `.gitignore` is based on `templates/gitignore.in`, with `disc_probe.json`
  ignored and broader config, env, capture and image patterns.
- `codegen_setup.c` ends with a blank line, byte-identical to the template
  output (`git diff --check` flags it).

## Phase 2 (commit `e58cf21`)

`generated/`: 49 files, 72,927,315 bytes, 1701 functions from 697 seeds,
byte-identical across runs and when regenerated in a fresh-clone export.
`generate` builds its emitters with clang 23.1.1 in `build-recompiler/` after a
one-time `build_emitters.sh`; the release and dev builds (GCC 16.2.1, CI
template flags) link with one warning, in the vendored `stb_image.h`. A
no-input smoke matrix (HLE OpenBIOS, LLE OpenBIOS, LLE SCPH-1001) reached frame
7200 with no dispatch, segment or unknown-dispatch miss. The runtime build
writes the framework's ignored `overlay_codegen_hash.h` inside the submodule
whenever it is missing or stale (`psxrecomp/runtime/hash_codegen.cmake:47-53`).
Review: rounds 1 and 2 NEEDS CHANGES (documentation), round 3 PASS on tree
`8ab2284`. The full record is in `git show e58cf21:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 3 change 1 (commit `fc06141`)

`scripts/routes/run_route.py` plays a route in the format of
`psxrecomp/tools/perf_routes/` on the headless dev build through the runtime's
native `input_route_*` commands
(`psxrecomp/runtime/src/debug_server.c:8031-8097`; one step frame per runtime
frame, `main.cpp:7524`). A run fails unless the boot banner matches the mode,
the route plays to its end within the timeout, no unknown-dispatch or segment
miss is reported, and the runtime exits 0 after `quit`.
`scripts/routes/test_run_route.py` checks the runner against a fake runtime (15
tests), and `scripts/routes/title_to_zone1.json` reaches zone-1 gameplay in all
three modes. Facts carried forward: `psx-beetle` cannot replay routes at this
pin (`psxrecomp/runtime/src/beetle_debug_server.c:1847-1855`); route start
frames vary (22 to 112 in that change's saved runs); shots trail the end of
their step by 0 to 16 frames; the runner passes `PSX_OVERLAY_CAPTURES` through,
so route runs add to `build-dev/overlay_captures.json` (ignored). Of the 32
captures saved by then, 28 equal a scene `.BIN` (LOGO, MOVIE, TITLE, BRI1) at
offset `load_addr - 0x80120000`, and none is a zone file. Review: round 1
NEEDS CHANGES (two Medium, four Low), round 2 NEEDS CHANGES (one Low), round 3
PASS on tree `ede62b41`. The full record is in
`git show fc06141:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 3 change 2 (commit `4c22512`)

`scripts/routes/menus.json` opens every main-menu screen except CAMPAIGN PLAY
(TRAINING, ZONE PLAY, REPLAY, LOAD/SAVE, RANKING, OPTION, and OPTION > CONTROL
SETUPS) and backs out of each. `scripts/routes/demo_zone1.json` to
`demo_zone6.json` play each zone's REPLAY > DEMONSTRATION recording until
shortly after its COMPLETED results screen, which shows the same clear time in
all three modes (zone 1 1:45.06, zone 2 3:30.36, zone 3 4:11.43, zone 4
3:37.83, zone 5 3:51.06, zone 6 3:38.20). `scripts/routes/test_routes.py`
checks the committed route files without a build: exactly the listed routes,
accepted by `run_route.load_route`, unique names that match the file names,
and every shot step ending at least 30 frames before the next button change.
All 24 runs (eight routes, three modes) passed with no miss. Facts carried
forward: the main-menu cursor does not skip ZONE PLAY, which opens a zone
select; in the DEMONSTRATION list, 1ST to 6TH ZONE can be selected, and 7TH,
8TH, U1, U4, U8 and V5 showed DISABLE when selected (LAST, U2, U3, U5, U6, U7
and U9 were never selected); the 53 captures in the `build-dev` store then
held 47 scene `.BIN` pages (TITLE, BRI1, TU, LOGO, MOVIE) and no zone file.
Review: round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (four Low, this file's observations), round 2
NEEDS CHANGES (one Low, the checks section), round 3 PASS on tree `acd0532`
with no findings. The full record is in `git show 4c22512:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 3 change 3 (commit `8d56854`)

`scripts/routes/memcard.json` saves the environment data from LOAD/SAVE to
memory card 1, slot 1 (SAVE COMPLETED), loads it back (CHECKING MEMORY CARD,
the LOAD SAVED DATA? prompt, Up to OK, OPENING DATA, DATA READ COMPLETED) and
returns to the main menu. It passed in all three modes with no miss, and each
run's memory card 1 then held one valid save, `BASCUS-94449OMEBENV` (8192
bytes, a title starting 【ＶＩＥＷ】), while memory card 2 stayed blank.
`AGENTS.md` lists the route, and a new route needs an entry in that list and
in `LISTED` in `scripts/routes/test_routes.py`. Facts carried forward: the
load prompt's cursor starts on CANCEL; the LOAD/SAVE cursor does not wrap,
while OPTION's wraps and is remembered between visits; the environment save
does not record DIFFICULTY or INFORMATION; scripted zone-1 input without
steering (Square held, with taps of each shoulder button) cleared only the
first wave, with a best score of 4115, and whether the zone then needs
steering is a hypothesis; `psxrecomp-analyze` at the pin found no function
outside the generated code, 23 direct calls into the scene-overlay area and
160 indirect transfers with no static target, so it gave no seed; GameFAQs
(unverified) says zones U1 to U9 and V5 and the boost levels unlock by
completing the game under difficulty, AP and continue conditions. Review:
round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (one Low, the zone-1 bullet), round 2 PASS on tree
`41ee4b2`. The full record is in `git show 8d56854:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 3 change 4 (commit `a4117a0`)

`aot/overlays.json` declares the 25 scene `.BIN` overlays whole at
0x80120000, guarded by the disc's data-track SHA-1, the loader instructions
that set that base (`0x80075AF4` to `0x80075B00` in `SCUS_944.49`) and 25
expected records. The framework's generic extractor places 19 of the files;
LOGO, U1, U3, U5, U8 and V5 use `allow_missing`, because their calls give too
few votes for one address. The documented `generate` writes
`generated/overlays_static.c`, `overlays_static_0000.c` to
`overlays_static_0024.c` and `AOT_STATIC_AUDIT.json` from the original disc
(34,846 variants, each guarded by the CRC of the bytes it came from; 124.8 MB
of C, largest file 10.8 MB), and reuses them while the generation inputs in
the audit, including the recompiler binary's sha256 and the gcc path, are
unchanged; a forced rebuild writes the same C, and only the audit's
`recipe_input_sha256` changes. `CMakeLists.txt` links the shard through
`GAME_OVERLAY_STATIC_C`, above `GEN_FULL_GLOB` and `CODEGEN_SETUP_SOURCES`
(after the first, configure fails; after the second, the codegen host drops
out of the link). With the shard, the interpreter's instructions at overlay
addresses fell from 353,737,535 to 1,309 on `title_to_zone1` and from
578,435,952 to 12 on `demo_zone1`, and stayed at or below 2,628 in all 27
route runs, all of which passed. Facts carried forward: captures place LOGO,
and RAM reads place S1 during zone-1 gameplay and U1, U3, U5, U8 and V5 during
their replays, all at 0x80120000. Review round 3 reproduced the reads of the
five replay files (not S1's) on its own build of the committed tree and
counted every agreeing byte: U5 and V5 differ from their files in only 116
bytes each, in 18 small ranges starting at the first difference
(`phase3-4/r3/review-r3.md`; the change's own script counted only the bytes
before that difference). A few overlay PCs still go to
the interpreter (0x80120370 in every route, 0x80135EFC in `menus` and
`memcard`, seven PCs in `title_to_zone1`). The loader's `static_hits` counted
15.7 to 16.2 million dispatches into the shard per run, and
`PSX_OVERLAY_AUTOCOMPILE_OFF=1` changed nothing observable, because this build
has no overlay toolchain. Review: round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (two Low, this file's
wording), round 2 NEEDS CHANGES (one Low, `AGENTS.md`'s rebuild rule), round 3
PASS on tree `9ceae0d` with no findings. The full record is in
`git show a4117a0:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 3 change 5 (commit `2a3fe3a`)

`scripts/routes/run_route.py` accepts the route key `card1_sha256`: such a
route runs only with `--card1` naming a readable 131,072-byte image with that
sha256 (size, read and hash checked before launch, one-line refusals), and the
runner copies the image into the run's `memcards/card1.mcd`. Thirteen routes,
`demo_zone7.json`, `demo_zone8.json`, `demo_zone_last.json`,
`demo_zone_u1.json` to `demo_zone_u9.json` and `demo_zone_v5.json`, load the
user's unlocked save with LOAD SLOT1 and play each zone's DEMONSTRATION replay
to its results screen. The save is GameFAQs save 20242 for Omega Boost, "All
Zones Unlocked (Gamesharked)", a North American DexDrive file the user
downloaded; its raw card image (`.cache/saves/all-zones.mcd`, ignored, sha256
`e3b71c252ce2…`) opens all 19 DEMONSTRATION entries and ZONE PLAY zones.
Against the game's own save it sets 19 one-byte flags at 0x200 to 0x212 and 13
at 0x214 to 0x220 of the save block (hypothesis: zone unlocks, then boost
levels). All 66 runs (22 routes in three modes) passed with no miss, and each
new zone shows the same CLEAR TIME in every mode: 7TH 4:15.50, 8TH 1:26.60,
LAST 4:39.06, U1 2:29.66, U2 2:04.76, U3 0:48.23, U4 1:39.36, U5 0:49.56, U6
0:56.43, U7 1:28.60, U8 0:59.86, U9 1:47.53, V5 0:44.33. After a run, card 1
differs from the image only in its write-test frame (frame 63, offset 0x1F80;
the writer was not traced); a card the runtime formats keeps frame 63 as a
copy of frame 0 unless the run rewrites it
(`psxrecomp/runtime/src/memcard.c:45-84`). Since review round 2, every
argument subtest of the runner tests starts from a clean state, so a mutation
fails only the subtests it affects. Review: round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (three Low: a
preload test that could not fail, two misattributed change 4 review rounds in
this file, a traceback on an unreadable `--card1`), round 2 PASS on tree
`91d6447` with no findings. The full record is in
`git show 2a3fe3a:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Spike: replays and the campaign script (scratch, harness-assisted)

The user chose a time-boxed scratch spike for what scripted routes cannot
reach (`.cache/evidence/spike-replay/`). Each of `REPLAY/REPLAY00.DAT` to
`REPLAY18.DAT` (23,404 bytes) holds one zone's recorded input, an 8-byte input
state per 30 fps game frame, run-length coded (`decode_replay.py`,
`decode.log`); its frame count, difficulty and level match the zone's
DEMONSTRATION entry. Every recording steers with the analog stick, off centre
in 82 to 99% of its frames (`stick_use.py` / `.log`), and routes carry only
the 16 button bits. CAMPAIGN PLAY's loop (0x8002F814) walks a 17-step script
at 0x8001232C: two briefings, nine zones, four between-zone movies (INTER1 to
INTER4), END_ALL and the staff credits. Rewriting the script pointer and step
that its callees save on the stack (debug-server memory writes;
`spike_ending.py`, `spike_tour.py`) skipped the zones: the four movies,
END_ALL, the credits and the closing copyright screen ran with no miss
(`runs/ending/`, `runs/tour/`). After a Start press on the copyright screen,
the game entered state 7, whose handler (`func_8002DC48`) calls the replay
player's step (0x80077228), and the function at 0x800571B8 called the scene
entry stored when BRI1 started (0x80120EAC) while other data filled the
overlay area there (a reserved opcode), so the runtime halted on an unknown
dispatch
(`runs/tour/postmortem.log`). The writes skipped every zone step, so this may
be an artifact of the harness (hypothesis); psx-beetle has no memory-write
command, so only genuine play to the ending can settle it.

## Phase 4 change 1 (commit `6d0a173`)

`scripts/build_beetle.sh` builds psx-beetle, the framework's Beetle PSX
oracle, out of tree in `.cache/beetle/`: archives of the framework commits
that HEAD pins (the submodule checkout is never written), beetle-psx-libretro
`5759277be500…` with the framework's seven patches, then `ninja psx-beetle`
(sha256 `63d0e568a6e5…`). `scripts/routes/beetle_route.py` plays a committed
route on it in `lle-openbios` or `lle-scph1001` mode. psx-beetle has no
`input_route_*`, memory-write or quit command, so the driver keeps one debug
connection, follows the frame count and sends each press, and each shot once
its step has ended, with a `ping` on the frame before: every event lands on
its route frame, counted from `--start`, or the run fails. A run also fails if
the BIOS image's sha256 is not its framework profile's, or if Beetle's log
does not report that image's SHA-1. Beetle reads the memory cards from its
working directory as `<disc name>.0.mcr` and `.1.mcr`, and saves a changed
card about two emulated seconds after the game's last write to it and again on
exit if it changed since; the driver writes the cards under those names and
fails a run if psx-beetle writes any other file there. The first full batch
had used the `dummy.*.mcr` names from a warn-only log check, files Beetle
never loads, so its 26 unlocked-save runs never had the save. Unpaced, Beetle
takes about 3 ms per frame, the driver's whole window to answer a ping; one
first-batch run landed its first shot a frame late and passed when run again.
`scripts/routes/test_beetle_route.py` has 15 tests against a fake psx-beetle;
eleven mutations, each removing one safeguard, all fail them. The second and
third batches passed all 22 routes in both modes (44 runs each, byte-identical
to each other). On the 19 replays' results screens the banner, CLEAR TIME,
DESTROY RATIO and PILOT ABILITY text is the same on both emulators: 33 of the
38 replay-mode pairs match by the comparison's pixel rule. Of the other five,
zone 7 (both modes) and LAST (SCPH-1001) differ only in pixels outside the
glyphs (zone 7: background pixels lit by the light sweep; LAST: the mech model
behind the text), and U1 (both modes) fails the rule because Beetle has fewer
than two results shots (`phase4-1/compare_results.log`), and on its one shot
those four rows have no differing pixel; the same text was read at 2x. In 24
pairs both sides show the same SCORE BONUS figure; in the
other 14 the figures differ as a tally still counting would (derived). U1's
mid-replay results screen matches in a finer-sampled scratch run.
`title_to_zone1`, `menus` and `memcard` show the same screens in the same order
(title, menu and memory card screens 90.2 to 99.9% equal in RGB, zone-1
gameplay 73 to 74%). In LLE OpenBIOS both emulators leave byte-identical cards
after every route; in SCPH-1001 mode every card the game rewrote differs in
seven bytes of its write-test frame (frame 63): words 2 and 3 of the BIOS's
exception stub on Beetle, zeros on psx-runtime (explained in change 2). The
intro screens that differed by boot mode are points of one sequence that all
five runs (three psx-runtime boot modes, two Beetle) show in the same order;
Beetle reaches each screen later than psx-runtime in the same BIOS mode
(hypothesis: CD timing). Review: round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (six Low), round 2
NEEDS CHANGES (two Low), round 3 PASS on tree `7598286` with no findings. The
full record is in `git show 6d0a173:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 4 change 2 (commit `a005f9e`)

Bookkeeping after the first watched play session
(`.cache/evidence/phase4-2/`). On 2026-10-20 the user played the windowed
`build-dev` binary on the SCPH-1001 v2.2 dump with an analog pad (a Flydigi
Vader 3 in X-input mode, which needed the kernel's `xpad` driver; seen in the
kernel log at the time, not saved), watched by `play/watch_play.py`
(read-only debug-server polls every 2 s, a screenshot every 30 s). Zones 1 to
3 of CAMPAIGN PLAY were cleared, and zone 4 was paused before the title
screen. Card 1 holds an environment save from the menus, byte-identical to the
`memcard` route's (derived from hashes and file times). No earlier run had
used the card directory: every run writes a `.pst_bios_isolated` marker into
it at startup (`psxrecomp/runtime/src/main.cpp:17801-17819`,
`savestate.c:393`), only where none exists (`savestate.c:227-228`), and the
marker's time is this session's. The window closed at frame 64,634 with no
unknown dispatch or segment miss in the exit report or in any watcher poll;
the polls show 73.5 frames/s in the first minute after the server answered
(frames 41 to 4,460) and 59.9 frames/s after that (`watch.log`). The
interpreter's overlay rows held 849 instructions from frame 18,869 to 54,917,
831 of them at five PCs the routes also interpret (0x80120370 in every route:
`phase3-5/probe_summary.log`, and `phase3-4/r2/pc_entries.log` for
`title_to_zone1`). Findings, all framework behaviour: the line
through the title screen comes from the bilinear filter, whose shaders wrap a
neighbour texel to the far side of a 256-texel page before clamping it
(`psxrecomp/runtime/src/gpu_gl_renderer.c:1402`, `:1410-1411`; reproduced on
a scratch copy; that it makes the session's line is derived), psxrecomp #719;
bilinear also blurs the 2D UI, and the 3D-only "stable" mode is reachable only
from a mod plugin and only on OpenGL, #720; the user plays with Nearest for
now. At the first dispatch of the game's entry the runtime clears RAM
0x00-0x0F and then drops the BIOS's stub-copy stores there
(`psxrecomp/runtime/src/fntrace.c:55-64`, `memory.c:189-191`, `:1956-1989`),
where psx-spx and Beetle keep a copy of the exception stub: that is change 1's
SCPH-1001 write-test difference, #721. In the probe's third run the low words
change at frames 388 (word 0 = 3), 896 (cleared) and 1,049 (the game's first
write); the first run, whose trace shows the frame-389 writers (delay loops in
the relocated BIOS shell), saw 389, 895 and 1,048. The launcher writes
`keybinds.ini`, `config.ini`, `input.ini` and `launcher-window.ini` beside the
executable, and when it closes, by PLAY or Quit, `settings.toml` there and
`[controller] multitap_analog` into the `--game` file (PLAY also writes
`bios.cfg` and `disc.cfg`). Later runs from that directory read them, so a
`hle-openbios` route from `build-dev/` booted SCPH-1001. The files moved to a
play copy, `.cache/play/build/`, which `play/play.sh` refreshes from
`build-dev/` and runs with its own `game.toml` and persistent cards in
`.cache/play/memcards/`; the tracked `game.toml` is back to HEAD, and
`AGENTS.md` says the launcher runs only from such a copy. Review: round 1
NEEDS CHANGES (five Low), round 2 PASS on tree `58a89e7` with no findings;
round 2's four wording suggestions are applied in this section (the
card-marker citation, the frame rates, the 0x80120370 citation, the probe
runs' frames). The full record is in `git show a005f9e:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 5 change 1 (commit `390a09b`)

Docs: the modding research the user asked for (new levels, branching paths,
unlocks, an eventual fan sequel or remake, Colony Wars' free roaming in Omega
Boost's engine), done on 2026-10-20 by three read-only research agents (the
framework's mod system, Omega Boost's internals, Colony Wars with prior art)
and checked against the pinned source, the disc and the web. The write-up is
`docs/MODDING_FEASIBILITY.md`; its evidence is in
`.cache/evidence/mod-research/` (among others `framework-check.txt`,
`verify_internals.py` / `.log`, `internals/`, `cw_check.py` / `.log`,
`gamehacking-codes.txt`, `prior-art.log`, `plugin-linking.log`,
`cmake-repeat-keyword.log`, `time-extension-article.txt`,
`time-extension-date.log`, `loader-dis.txt`, `precedents.log`, and
`level_labels.sh` / `.log` with `level-labels/`). The zone list's LEVEL labels
in change 5's `12-zone-cursor.png` shots are each zone's DEMONSTRATION level
value plus 1 for values 0 to 8, B for 10 and D for 12, the same in all three
boot modes; U1's, which only the draft left unclear, reads B in the 10x glyph
comparison with 8TH's "8" (`level-labels/glyphs-8-u1-u3.png`). The GameFAQs
cheats page now answers scripted fetches with HTTP 403 and no record saved
its unlock list, so the write-up does not compare the unlock rules with it.
`AGENTS.md` and the Phase 3 change 4 section above said the four words the
static overlay step checks set the overlay base. The scene loader branches
past them (0x80075AEC) when the scene has a `.BIN`, so they run only for a
scene without one, putting its data at 0x80120000; with a `.BIN` the data
goes after the file (`loader-dis.txt`). `AGENTS.md` now says so; the check
still pins loader code beside the overlay load. The user's account posted a
comment on psxrecomp #721: the issue's frame-1200 comparison may catch Beetle
before its game starts, and the card bytes are the like-for-like evidence
(`phase4-2/upstream/issue-3-comment-1.md`). The user then chose the "unlock
all zones and boost levels" mod as the next change. Review: round 1 NEEDS
CHANGES (three Low, all in the doc), round 2 PASS on tree `034e6be` with no
findings. The full record is in `git show 390a09b:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.

## Phase 5 change 2 observations (`.cache/evidence/phase5-2/`)

- The framework at the pin: a VBlank plugin runs at every emulated VBlank for
  each plugin id the resolved plan activates
  (`psxrecomp/runtime/src/mod_runtime.cpp:2184-2193`).
  `psx_mod_game_started()` returns `fntrace_is_game_started()`
  (`:2195-2197`). `psx_mod_write_byte` is a host store (`:2312-2314`,
  `memory.c:2509-2513`): it takes the guest store path but is never
  cache-isolated (`memory.c:1797-1801`). A package targets a game by
  `game_id`, and by `exe_sha256` or `disc_sha256` only if it sets them
  (`mod_packages.cpp:682-684`); release installs carry no loose EXE to hash
  (`mod_runtime.cpp:1328-1333`). `save_compatibility` is parsed and
  validated (`mod_packages.cpp:1724-1725`, `:1745-1746`), and nothing else
  in the runtime's sources or recomp-ui reads it. The plugin audit
  (`--audit-mod-plugins`, `main.cpp:14226-14250`) runs as a ctest only under
  `BUILD_TESTING` (`runtime.cmake:1360-1371`), so this change runs it by
  hand. `psxrecomp_add_game_runtime` forwards its unparsed arguments and then
  adds its own `EXTRAS_SOURCES` (`runtime.cmake:2727`, `:2747-2751`), and
  repeated keyword values accumulate (Phase 5 change 1's CMake test). The
  closest precedent, MegaManX4Recomp's cheat packages (`reference/`), are
  format 5 manifests in group Cheats, off by default, whose plugin uses
  function-entry hooks.
- Builds (`build-dev.log`, `build-release.log`): the new package directory
  re-ran CMake (a globbed path changed), and the build staged 7 packages (1
  game-owned, 6 framework-owned) into `mods/bundled/`, compiled
  `src/mods/omega_unlock_all.c` and relinked. `build-dev/Omega_Thrust` is
  now `64f65d9d2f0a…` (it was `07ff31595b9c…`), `build-release/Omega_Thrust`
  `dde8de1bf342…`. Both link `omega_register_unlock_all` and
  `unlock_all_vblank`, and both staged manifests equal the source. The audit
  passes with the framework and game catalogs (7 manifests, 7 declared ids,
  7 registered ids) and fails with the framework's alone, which leaves
  `omega.unlock-all` undeclared, so it sees the plugin (`plugin-audit.log`).
- Feature off, every committed route (`routes.sh` / `routes.log`): the 22
  routes in all three modes with the documented commands on the new
  `build-dev`, whose `mods/state.toml` names no package of this change. All
  66 runs pass, with matching banners, no miss, every screenshot taken,
  start frames 21 to 142 and shot lags up to 18 frames
  (`routes_summary.log`); the save image and the binary did not change
  (`inputs-before.sha256`, `inputs-after.sha256`). In every run the plugin's
  counter stays 0, and the interpreter's overlay instruction and row counts
  equal change 5 round 2's (`probe_summary.log`, `probe/`). All 19 replays
  reach their results screens in all three modes (`clear_time_check.log`),
  and `card_check.py` finds no problem: card 1 of the card routes differs
  from the save only in the write-test frame (`card_check.log`). The
  `memcard` route saves the game's own card, `42dd8d89acd1…`, as before.
- Feature on (`mod_runs.sh` / `mod_runs.log`, outputs in `runs/`). Two run
  directories outside the build (`mod_view.sh`) hold copies of `build-dev`'s
  binary, `bios/`, `assets/`, `game_options.toml`, `psx_game_version.txt`
  and `mods/bundled/`, and a `mods/state.toml` that names the package with
  the feature on or off. Two scratch routes (`gen_mod_routes.py`,
  `routes-mod/`): `unlock-on` (198 steps, 16,598 frames) walks ZONE PLAY's
  level and zone lists and the DEMONSTRATION list, then saves to card 1;
  `unlock-saved` loads card 1 first, then walks the same lists. The runs use
  port 4372, and `probe.py` samples the plugin counter and the flags. In
  each of the three modes:
  - `unlock-on` with the feature on passes. The plugin counted 64 writes,
    the last during boot (frames 422, 720 and 1,047), and at the last sample
    A[0..18] and B[0..13] are set and neither clear flag
    (`mod_probe_summary.log`). In the screenshots (`status_check.py` /
    `.log`, which match each status word against crops read on screen),
    every zone and level is OPENED, ZONE PLAY's header says SELECT OK in all
    32 zone and level shots, and all 19 DEMONSTRATION entries say SELECT OK.
  - With the feature off the same route passes, the counter stays 0, only
    A[0] and B[0] are set, the screens show only 1ST ZONE and level 1 OPENED
    (the header SELECT OK only for that pair) and the rest CLOSED or
    DISABLE, and DEMONSTRATION entries 1 to 6 say SELECT OK, as Phase 3
    change 2 found.
  - The feature-on save is the same card in all three modes
    (`2fefb5154ef4…`). It holds A[0..18] and B[0..13] and no clear flag, and
    its checksum holds: 0x09F245F2, the GameFAQs save's 0x09F244F2 plus
    0x100 for B[13] (`card_flags.py`, first checked on both known cards).
    The feature-off save is the game's own `42dd8d89acd1…`.
  - `unlock-saved` with the feature off and that card passes: every zone,
    level and entry is open, the counter stays 0, and card 1 is unchanged.
  - psx-beetle, which runs no plugins, plays `unlock-saved` with the same
    cards in both of its modes, every press on its frame, and shows every
    zone and level OPENED and every entry SELECT OK.
  - The on and off runs' interpreter totals differ by under 0.1%, with the
    same 1,446 overlay instructions (`runs/*-probe.json`).
- 64 writes is more than the 33 flags, so something reset some of them
  during boot after the plugin first set them; which code did is not traced.

## Phase 5 change 2 changes

- `src/mods/omega_unlock_all.c` (new): the trusted plugin `omega.unlock-all`.
  At every VBlank once the game has started it writes 1 to each of A[0..18]
  (0x800A7E20) and B[0..13] (0x800A7E34) that is not already 1, and counts
  each write as `omega.unlock-all.writes` (debug command `mod_counters`).
  A[19] and B[14], which no screen shows, are left alone.
- `mods/preloaded/packages/omega.cheat.unlock-all/1.0.0/manifest.toml`
  (new): format 7, target `SCUS-94449` with no EXE or disc hash (the plugin
  changes no disc data, and release installs have no loose EXE), one
  feature, `unlock-all` ("Unlock All Zones and Boost Levels", group Cheats,
  off by default), whose description says a save made while it is on keeps
  the unlocks, and the `[[plugin]]` `omega.unlock-all`.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: `EXTRAS_SOURCES` with the plugin, above `GEN_FULL_GLOB`,
  where a multi-value keyword would take it as one of its own values.
- `AGENTS.md`: a "Mods" section: the catalog and plugin layout, the audit
  command, what the package does, and how to try a feature (the play copy's
  Mods page, or a headless run from a copied build with its own
  `mods/state.toml`), with `build-dev/mods/state.toml` enabling none.
- `docs/MODDING_FEASIBILITY.md`: step 1 of the recommended path is marked
  done, with its results. Change 1's four round-2 doc suggestions: the
  resource-path citation and "guest memory" (RAM, SPU RAM and VRAM); the
  cheat's two writes, with the boost-level reading labelled an inference;
  A[19] and B[14] as an unknown; the X6 Tweaks wording, from the README
  lines now saved in `mod-research/precedents.log`.
- `.agent/HANDOFF.md`: this scope; Phase 5 change 1 condensed, with its
  round-2 handoff suggestion applied (U1's label was unclear only in the
  draft, and the glyph comparison is at 10x); these sections; the
  hypotheses; the review state; the next action.
- Untracked (ignored): the evidence in `.cache/evidence/phase5-2/` and the
  README lines appended to `.cache/evidence/mod-research/precedents.log`.

## Phase 5 change 2 checks

- `phase5-2/checks-p5-2.sh` / `.log` (staged tree; the index tree is
  computed in a scratch object directory, and the script runs no runtime):
  all pass. Only the six intended paths change; the header and the Phase 0
  to Phase 4 change 2 sections of this file equal HEAD; there is no
  placeholder, doubled blank line, added line over 80 columns or local
  path, and the doc no longer says nothing is implemented. The three gates
  pass, the pins and submodules are unchanged and clean, only psxrecomp's
  `overlay_codegen_hash.h` is ignored there, and neither new file is
  ignored. `build-dev` is newer than the three build inputs; both builds
  link the plugin and stage the manifest unchanged; the audit passes for
  both and fails with the framework catalog alone; the framework lines
  above are printed. From the runs' outputs: 66 feature-off runs started
  and passed, the save image and binary did not change,
  `build-dev/mods/state.toml` names no package of this change, the plugin
  counter is 0 in every run, and the overlay counters equal change 5 round
  2's; `probe_summary.py`, `clear_time_check.py`, `card_check.py`,
  `mod_probe_summary.py` and `status_check.py` reproduce their logs;
  `card_flags.py` passes on the six `unlock-on` cards, the game's own save
  and the GameFAQs save; each `unlock-saved` run left card 1 unchanged; the
  generator reproduces both scratch routes. The three route test files pass
  and leave nothing behind; no listener is left; `git diff --cached --check`
  is clean. The first run (`checks-p5-2-first.log`) found one line naming
  "omega" in `build-dev/mods/state.toml`: the HD-texture pack path, which
  contains the repository's name. The check now looks for the package id.

## Hypotheses and unknowns

- The intro screens that differed by boot mode at equal frame numbers (Phase
  2, `git show e58cf21:.agent/HANDOFF.md`, and Phase 3 change 1) are points
  of one sequence that every mode, and Beetle, shows in the same order (Phase
  4 change 1, intro). Why Beetle reaches each screen later than psx-runtime in
  the same BIOS mode, at boot, in the intro and at the results screens:
  unknown (hypothesis: Beetle's CD timing).
- Whether the eight emitted fallthroughs are faithful: unknown.
- Untested by committed routes: TRAINING lessons, ZONE PLAY zones, and SAVE
  REPLAY and LOAD REPLAY, which scripted menu input may reach; CAMPAIGN PLAY
  past zone 1, the ending and credits, which need steering. Zones 1 to 4 of
  CAMPAIGN PLAY and a save to card 1 ran once under live play without a miss
  (change 2); live input is neither recorded nor compared with Beetle. The
  DEMONSTRATION routes run all 19 zones, but under recorded input; whether
  that reaches the code live play reaches is unknown. Any of the 160
  statically unresolved indirect transfers that neither reached can still
  miss later.
- The unlocked save is user-made ("Gamesharked"): the routes show which
  replays its flags open, not that completing the game writes the same flags;
  per the internals research the game's unlock rules cannot produce it
  (agent, derived: it has U1's and level B's flags, which need a HARD clear,
  but no clear flag). Its bytes are the zone flags A[0..18] and boost-level
  flags B[0..12] of the environment save, and its checksum, the 32-bit sum of
  the block's 68 words at +0x200, holds (re-checked on both card images, Phase
  5 change 1). The unlock mod (change 2) shows that ZONE PLAY and
  DEMONSTRATION follow those flags and that a save keeps them; that the game
  verifies the checksum is still the agent's static reading, not traced.
- Overlay code now runs from the static shard, except a few PCs that still go
  to the interpreter (0x80120370 in every route; 0x80135EFC in `menus`,
  `memcard` and the 13 unlocked-zone routes, 1,182 instructions in each of
  those 13; seven PCs in `title_to_zone1`; `phase3-4/probe_summary.log`,
  `phase3-5/probe_summary.log`, which show each run's top three PCs, and
  `phase3-4/r2/pc_entries.log` for 0x80120370 in `title_to_zone1`). The
  shard has no entry at 0x80135EFC (`phase3-4/r2/pc_entries.py` / `.log`, the
  probes' top five PCs against the audit). 0x80120370 has a MOVIE variant but
  lies below the runtime's overlay region floor, 0x120800, the end of the EXE
  text (`runtime.log`). The other four `title_to_zone1` PCs the probe kept
  (0x80127690, 0x801276B0, 0x801264B8, 0x8012649C) have variants only from
  S8, BRI2, S6 and U7, so other code at those addresses fails the CRC guard
  (hypothesis). Along the committed routes, Beetle, which runs the original
  overlay code, shows the same results text (and the same SCORE BONUS figure
  in 24 of the 38 pairs; in the others it was still counting, derived), the
  same screens in the same order and (in OpenBIOS mode) the same cards. Why
  the game runs code at those PCs, and whether the shard behaves like the
  interpreter beyond the routes: unknown. In the live session (change 2) the
  overlay rows held 849 interpreted instructions, 831 of them at five of
  those PCs (three rows, 18 instructions, are not named), and the total did
  not change from frame 18,869 to frame 54,917, in zone 4; the rest of zone 4
  was not sampled. `full_static_coverage_proven` is false: code the extractor
  cannot find statically still goes to the interpreter.
- In SCPH-1001 mode, psx-runtime's RAM lacks the BIOS's exception stub at
  0x80000004 to 0x8000000F, which Beetle has: the runtime clears RAM
  0x00-0x0F when the game starts and then drops the BIOS's stub-copy stores
  there (change 2), reported as psxrecomp #721. In Omega Boost it changes
  only the card's write-test frame; no game-visible effect has been seen.
- recomp-ui `864f778`: the launcher dashboard works, and PLAY started the
  game in play session 1 (change 2). It saves its state beside the executable
  and into the `--game` file, so it runs only from the play copy.
- With bilinear filtering, psxrecomp's OpenGL and Vulkan shaders wrap
  neighbour texels across 256-texel page edges (#719), and the filter also
  smooths the 2D UI (#720); the user plays with Nearest for now. The route
  runner and the Beetle comparisons use headless software-renderer captures,
  which no filter setting reaches while `build-dev/` holds no `settings.toml`.
- Modding: the open questions are in `docs/MODDING_FEASIBILITY.md`, section
  7. Its claims marked "agent" come from a research agent's static reading of
  the disc and were not re-checked, except those the unlock mod exercises
  (change 2). Whether the launcher's Mods page lists the package and turns
  it on is not yet seen: the checks set the selection in `mods/state.toml`.

## Review and commit state

- Phase 1: round 2 PASS on tree `b5ef902`; commit `6ad5c9e`.
- Phase 2: round 3 PASS on tree `8ab2284`; commit `e58cf21`.
- Phase 3 change 1: round 3 PASS on tree `ede62b41`; commit `fc06141`.
  Deferred suggestions: ignore SIGINT during the runner's cleanup (round 2),
  and enforce one runtime per build with a lock file (round 3).
- Phase 3 change 2: round 3 PASS on tree `acd0532` (staged diff `9683aa9c…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (four Low) and round 2 NEEDS
  CHANGES (one Low); commit `4c22512`, pushed to the private `origin/master`.
- Phase 3 change 3: round 2 PASS on tree `41ee4b2` (staged diff `ab8c63aa…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (one Low, the zone-1 bullet);
  commit `8d56854`, pushed to the private `origin/master`. Round 2's three
  wording suggestions concern the committed record and are noted here: six Ups
  from LOAD SLOT2 end on LOAD SLOT1 whether or not the cursor wraps, so
  `difficulty3-top` is not no-wrap evidence (`load-slot1` and `difficulty3`
  are); in `explore-memcard`, the screens left the script at the load, while
  its OPTION presses had already landed on other rows than intended, because
  OPTION wraps and remembers its cursor; "its second Cross" means the load's
  second Cross.
- Phase 3 change 4: round 3 PASS on tree `9ceae0d` (staged diff `a248fe03…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES (two Low: the fresh-export
  check reused rather than reproduced the shard, and the six `allow_missing`
  files are call-sparse, not small) and round 2 NEEDS CHANGES (one Low: which
  recompiler change forces a shard rebuild); commit `a4117a0`, pushed to the
  private `origin/master`. Reports: `phase3-4/review-r1.md`,
  `phase3-4/r2/review-r2.md`, `phase3-4/r3/review-r3.md`. Round 3's one
  suggestion (record its reproduction of the RAM reads and the U5 and V5 byte
  counts) is adopted in the change 4 section above. Still deferred: naming the
  last two interpreted `title_to_zone1` PCs (0x80126160 and 0x801261AC, from
  the reviewer's own round-1 probe, reported in round 2).
- Phase 3 change 5: round 2 PASS on tree `91d6447` (staged diff `5ecf0036…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES on tree `a831f14` (three Low:
  the preload test could not fail, because the fake runtime only read the
  card; two misattributed change 4 review rounds in this file; a traceback on
  an unreadable `--card1`); commit `2a3fe3a`, pushed to the private
  `origin/master`. Reports: `phase3-5/review-r1.md`, `phase3-5/r2/review-r2.md`.
  Declined in round 2: capping the pixel rule at the full counts, which would
  drop 20 real results screens (`phase3-5/r2/capped-dropped_sheet.png`). Round
  2's suggestions: "a mutation fails only the subtests it affects" (applied in
  the change 5 section above); the commit message's spike wording (fixed in
  the commit); the debug server's `set_input` and `press` take stick axes
  `lx`, `ly`, `rx` and `ry` (`psxrecomp/runtime/src/debug_server.c:7951-7980`),
  so the recordings' stick values could be injected without a framework
  change, though not frame-exactly (in Next action); a label bound near 600 in
  the evidence pixel rule (evidence tooling, deferred). Still deferred: the
  demo routes' fine-cadence notes (fixed when they are next regenerated),
  ignoring SIGINT during the runner's cleanup, a lock file for one runtime per
  build, and naming the last two interpreted `title_to_zone1` PCs.
- Phase 4 change 1: round 3 PASS on tree `7598286` (staged diff `3c600242…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES on tree `9706929` (six Low:
  when Beetle saves the cards, zone 7's differing pixels, U1's mid-replay
  results screen, the results claim's coverage, the prototype's failures, the
  commit message) and round 2 NEEDS CHANGES on tree `9d7f44a` (two Low: five
  SCORE BONUS pairs recorded as still counting, the light sweep's share of
  zone 7's pixels); commit `6d0a173`, pushed to the private `origin/master`.
  Reports: `phase4-1/review-r1.md`, `phase4-1/r2/review-r2.md`,
  `phase4-1/r3/review-r3.md`. Deferred: tests for the driver's
  connect-too-late and reply-id checks (each needs a new fake behaviour; the
  next driver change), and a finer shot cadence where a replay shows a
  mid-replay results screen (a route change). The full entries are in
  `git show a005f9e:.agent/HANDOFF.md`.
- Phase 4 change 2: round 2 PASS on tree `58a89e7` (staged diff `c0135069…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES on tree `2180832` (five Low:
  the session's card save, which interpreter rows the watcher kept, the trace
  sentence, the launcher's Quit writes, two numbers); commit `a005f9e`,
  pushed to the private `origin/master`. Reports: `phase4-2/review-r1.md`,
  `phase4-2/r2/review-r2.md`. Round 2's four wording suggestions are applied
  in the change 2 section above. The comment on #721 that round 1 left to the
  user was posted (Phase 5 change 1 observations).
- Phase 5 change 1: round 2 PASS on tree `034e6be` (staged diff `fa055e21…`)
  with no findings, after round 1 NEEDS CHANGES on tree `03d7a5f` (three Low,
  all in the doc: the persistence claim ignored that option values persist
  in `mods/state.toml`; "cannot carry code" misstated a citation that says
  native code; the GameFAQs comparison had no saved source); commit
  `390a09b`, pushed to the private `origin/master`. Reports:
  `phase5-1/review-r1.md`, `phase5-1/r2/review-r2.md`. Round 2's five
  wording suggestions are applied in this change: four in the doc, one in
  the change 1 section above.
- Phase 5 change 2, round 1: pending.

## Next action

After a PASS: commit and push. The next step is the user's choice; section 6
of `docs/MODDING_FEASIBILITY.md` proposes the branching prototype (step 2).
The unlock option can be tried in the play copy: `play.sh` refreshes
`.cache/play/build/` from `build-dev/`, `mods/bundled/` included, and the
launcher's Mods page should list "Unlock All Zones and Boost Levels" under
Cheats.

Play continues from the play copy: `play/play.sh <session dir> <SCPH-1001
dump>` (in `.cache/evidence/phase4-2/`) refreshes `.cache/play/build/` from
`build-dev/`, runs the windowed game there with its own `game.toml` and with
persistent cards in `.cache/play/memcards/`, and watches the debug server. The
play copy's settings still select bilinear filtering; the user's choice,
Nearest, is set in the launcher. Still unreached: CAMPAIGN PLAY zones 5 to 8
and LAST, the ending and credits (the spike reached the ending and credits
only by rewriting the campaign script, and its post-credits halt is
unexplained), TRAINING lessons, ZONE PLAY zones, SAVE REPLAY and LOAD REPLAY.
psxrecomp #719, #720 and #721 are open upstream; any fix arrives through a
reviewed pin bump. Independent changes: harvesting misses with
`psxrecomp/tools/collect_game_misses.py` (none so far); finding why Beetle
reaches screens later than psx-runtime (for example by comparing when each CD
read completes).
